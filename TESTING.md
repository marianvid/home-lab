# Test record

## Clean build — passed

- Date: 2026-08-05
- Host: AOOSTAR GEM12+ Pro reference system
- OS: Proxmox VE 9.2.2 / Debian 13
- Kernel: `7.0.2-6-pve`
- Source directory: newly created, separate from installed source trees

Verified sequence:

1. cloned pinned `aoostar-rs` commit;
2. checked and applied consolidated patch;
3. compiled `asterctl` and `aster-sysinfo` in release mode;
4. cloned pinned libfprint commit;
5. checked and applied touch-only patch;
6. configured and compiled an isolated `mafpmoc` libfprint build;
7. staged libfprint under `dist/rootfs/opt/libfprint-mafp`;
8. compiled gesture, calibration and power-button helpers;
9. packaged dashboard, runtime scripts, units and configuration examples;
10. validated expected artifacts, JSON and shell syntax;
11. rendered the Health panel in simulation from anonymous fixture values.

The build did not install files, modify services or use installed binaries as
build artifacts.

## Existing hardware integration — passed

The same source changes are active on the reference system and have been tested
with the physical LCD, persistent fingerprint touch input, adaptive Storage
layout, native USB4/NVMe SMART data and guarded Power menu.

## Scope

Passing on the reference system does not establish compatibility with other
Linux distributions, kernels, AOOSTAR revisions or fingerprint-reader firmware.

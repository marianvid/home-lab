# HOME LAB

An interactive Linux/Proxmox dashboard for the built-in LCD and fingerprint
sensor of the AOOSTAR GEM12+ Pro mini PC.

> [!WARNING]
> Experimental hardware-facing software. It changes display, fingerprint,
> ACPI power-button and system-service behavior. **Use entirely at your own
> risk.** Read [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) before building or deploying it.

> [!NOTE]
> HOME LAB is a disclosed **human–AI collaborative creation**. Product intent,
> interaction design and real-device validation are human-led; implementation
> and documentation were developed with AI assistance and human review. See
> [AI_DISCLOSURE.md](AI_DISCLOSURE.md).

The project turns otherwise underused hardware into a local headless-server
console. It presents live health, compute, optional NVIDIA GPU, storage, network
and service state.
The fingerprint reader is used only as a touch controller—tap for next, hold for
details/back—and does not extract or store biometric templates.

## Origin and acknowledgements

HOME LAB builds on [`aoostar-rs`](https://github.com/zehnm/aoostar-rs), created
by [Markus Zehnder (`@zehnm`)](https://github.com/zehnm). His reverse
engineering of the undocumented AOOSTAR display protocol and Rust
implementation made Linux control of the GEM12+ Pro LCD possible. This project
uses a pinned `aoostar-rs` revision and extends it with hierarchical manual
navigation, responsive external triggers, guarded system actions and adaptive
storage panels.

Fingerprint touch handling builds on the
[`libfprint`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint) project. HOME
LAB carries an opt-in patch for the MAFP reader that treats it as a touch
control without biometric enrollment. Full upstream revisions, modifications
and licenses are recorded in [THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md).

## Highlights

- Health, Compute, dynamic NVIDIA GPU, adaptive Storage, Network and Services panels.
- Compact OK/Warn/Err states with a slowly pulsing red error dot.
- NVMe SMART temperature, wear, bytes written, hours, available/capacity and
  media-error information.
- Dynamic internal-NVMe and removable-storage cards without placeholders for
  absent devices; same-model NVMe drives are distinguished by device identity.
- Optional NVIDIA panel with temperature, utilization, VRAM, power, process,
  DCGM health, clocks, ECC and Xid state; it disappears when no GPU is present.
- Persistent, low-latency tap/hold input through a patched libfprint driver.
- Guarded physical power-button menu with explicit confirmation and timeout.
- Reproducible build from pinned upstream commits; no universal installer.
- Simulator fixtures and distribution smoke tests.

## Interaction

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Sensor tap (`<400 ms`) | Next panel on the current level |
| Sensor hold (`≥400 ms`) | Enter details or return to overview |
| Physical Power tap | Open private System Actions menu |
| Sensor tap in menu | Toggle Reboot / Shutdown |
| Sensor hold in menu | Confirm selection |
| Five seconds without input | Cancel and restore previous panel |

Compact Health states preserve card space: `✓ OK`, a fixed amber `● Warn`, and
red `Err` with a slowly blinking dot.

## Tested platform

- AOOSTAR GEM12+ Pro, AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 8845HS
- Proxmox VE 9.2.2 / Debian, Linux `7.0.2-6-pve`
- LCD UART `0416:90a1`
- Microarray MAFP reader `3274:8012`
- Internal NVMe plus external Corsair EX400U in native USB4/NVMe mode
- NVIDIA RTX PRO 4500 Blackwell over OCuLink (PCIe 4.0 x4), driver 610 and CUDA 13.3

This is the verified reference, not a claim of compatibility with every Linux
distribution or AOOSTAR model.

## Reproducible build

The build writes only to `build/` and `dist/`; it does not install services or
change host configuration.

```bash
./scripts/build.sh --clean
./scripts/test-dist.sh
```

See [Build documentation](docs/build.md). Deployment is intentionally a manual,
reviewed administrator action; see the [manual deployment reference](docs/deployment.md)
and the [recorded test results](TESTING.md).
